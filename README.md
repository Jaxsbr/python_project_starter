# Python Project Starter

A terminal app that creates bare-bones Python code projects faster that doing it manually.

## How?

1. The app collects your desired project's details (name, venv name)
2. It generates a project structure in a configurable destination directory
3. It create `main.py`, `.gitignore` and `README.md` starter files in the project directory

## Why?

I create many of these projects for prototyping ideas and want to avoid doing it manually
